#NOTE1 (in code: main.cpp)
This is the part logic that is not be the same in Python and C++. Because c++ 
peg calculations are implemented to follow ConnectInputs() routines then all
fractions calculations will follow reorganizations of blocks and new fractions 
of same transactions will be replaced in pegdb.

#NOTE2 (in code: main.cpp)
This section scans for reorganizations. Same references as #NOTE1.

#NOTE3 (in code: txmempool.h)
Note that mempool now does not wipe transactions which does not fit peg. (todo)

#NOTE4
In C++ implemented via following same idea of transactions pools - ref example
map<uint256, CTxIndex>& mapTestPool argument in CTransaction::ConnectInputs()
For peg logics, added same following fractions pools - map<uint320, CFractions>.
Fractions pools always follow transactions pools and ensure fractions 
calculations happens in sync of transactions computations.

#NOTE5 (in code: peg.cpp)

#NOTE6 (in code: peg.cpp)
Note that referenced logic is located in two calls:
CalculateStandardFractions()
CalculateStakingFractions()
(note: separated due internal logic of calls of checks during ConnectBlock())

#NOTE7 (in code: peg.cpp)

#NOTE8 (in code: peg.cpp)
No direct call equivalent, but referencing:
CFractions::RatioPart()
CFractions::MoveRatioPartTo()
which do same in the context of logic.

#NOTE9 (in code: main.cpp)

#NOTE10
Peg leveldb uses uint320 key for fractions keys: (uint256 txid, uint64 out)
No refereces by addresses now.
